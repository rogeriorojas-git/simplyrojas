<p align="left"><img src="images/Rojas%20Coat%20of%20Arms.jpg" alt="Rojas Coat of Arms.jpg (11162 bytes)" align="left" WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="145"><font size="3">The ancient surname
of Roxas, Rojas or de Rojas originated in the city of Rojas, Burgos. It spread from there
to Palencia, Toledo and Andalucia. One of the first to take this name was Diego Sanchez,
who owned the village of Rojas, in Bribiesca, Burgos. He lived in the late 1100s. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">There were several Rojas families who presented themselves before the
various Offices of the Holy Inquisition. Agustin de Rojas and his wife, Juana del Valle,
submitted their genealogy. No date or place is given. Fernando Rojas y Gonzalez Cobo, of
Curiel, petitioned in 1673 for the position of Official de Valladolid. Baptismal
certificates and wills are contained in this petition. Fray Francisco Rojas, of the Order
of San Francisco and a native of Toledo, in 1623 petitioned for the position of
Calificador del Consejo in Toledo; Gaspar Rojas Victoria, a native of Guadalajara, and his
wife Francisca Rivera, of Granada, in 1593 petitioned for the position of Familiar in
Mexico City. Jose de Rojas ORtega, a native of Huamanga, Peru, petitioned the Inquisition
in Lima in 1730 for the office of Familiar. Juan de Rojas, petitioned the Inquisition at
Cartagena de Indias in 1645 for the office of Comisario. In 1621, Pedro de Rotas Valdes,
native of Tinco, resident of Manila, and his wife, Juana de la Cueva Herrera, native of
Manila, petitioned in Mexico City for the office of Familiar. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Family histories have been identified for the Rojas families in

<p><font size="3">In the United States, Rojas is the 73rd most popular surname among
modern Hispanic homilies. In Santa Cruz, Arizona, in 1821, Gavian Rojas lived with her
husband, Ramon Montiel and their two children, Toribio and Josefa. Felipe Rojas was the
husband of Barbara Figueroa. Living in the same household was Juliana Rojas, who might

<p><font size="3">In San Antonio, Texas, Juan Jose de Rojas served as a witness in 1722.
He had more than 15 years of military service. He had served under the Marques de Aguayo

the royal presidio of Adaes. He was in San Antonio again in 1726. He received a grant in
1741. His wife was Nicolasa Trevino. Their children were Juana Gertrudis, Basilio and
Rosalia. Another San Antonio family was that of Joseph Antonio de Rojas, who was there in
1731. He married Maria Curbelo and they had four children. One of them, Franciso, married
Antonia Granado, and the couple had nine children. These Rojas families have many
descendants throughout Texas. In Nacogdoches in 1805, Nicolas Rojas, a Spanish farmer, age
38, was marriedto Dorotea, a French woman, age 49(?). They had two sons and two daughters,
a grandson, and three granddaughters. </font></p>

Felipe, were the parents of Josef, Melchor, Francisco, Pedro, and Maria. There was also a
